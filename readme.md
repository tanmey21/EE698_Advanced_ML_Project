# 1. Project Overview:

- This project implements an English Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P) system using an RNN-Transducer (RNN-T) architecture.
- It models the sequence-to-sequence relationship between English words and their phonetic transcriptions using an encoder-predictor-joiner neural network trained end-to-end.
- We evaluated the system's performance using the Character Error Rate (CER) metric on the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary dataset.

# 2.Sample Examples:

#### Example-1:

- **Input (Grapheme):** `Pronounciation`
- **Predicted Phoneme Output:** ` P R OW N AH N S IY EY SH AH N`

#### Example-2:

- **Input (Grapheme):** `Wednesday`
- **Predicted Phoneme Output:** ` W EH N Z D IY`

#### Example-3:

- **Input (Grapheme):** `Physics`
- **Predicted Phoneme Output:** `F IH Z IH K S`

# 3.How to run the code:

- Run all cells except the cells to save and load the model
- Give input word in predict_word function to get its respective phonemes.

# 5.Dataset Used:

- Dataset: CMU Pronouncing Dictionary (via NLTK)

# 6.Model Architecture:

- Encoder: Embedding layer → LSTM → Packed Sequence
- Predictor: Embedding layer → LSTM (with blank token prepending)
- Joiner: Linear projections → ReLU activation → Output layer
- Loss: RNN-Transducer (RNN-T) Loss (torchaudio)
- Applied Beam Search Algorithm during testing to get the best output phonemes of given input word.

# 7.Evaluation:

- Metric: Character Error Rate (CER)
- Results:
  - Training CER: 13.6%
  - Test CER: 14.4%
